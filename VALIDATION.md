## Testing Notes

The plugin has been validated for the following functionality:

1. **Marqo API Connection**: The connector successfully communicates with the Marqo API, sending search queries and processing results.

2. **FiboSearch Integration**: The plugin correctly intercepts FiboSearch queries and injects Marqo results into the response.

3. **Admin Interface**: The settings page allows configuration of all necessary parameters and includes connection testing functionality.

4. **Caching**: Search results are properly cached and retrieved, with cache clearing functionality working as expected.

5. **Frontend Integration**: JavaScript integration enhances the user experience with custom styling for Marqo results.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

1. **Result Mapping**: The current implementation assumes certain field mappings between Marqo and FiboSearch. This could be made configurable in future versions.

2. **Advanced Filtering**: Additional filtering options could be added to refine Marqo search results.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimization could be implemented for high-traffic sites.

4. **Analytics**: Search analytics and reporting could be added in future versions.

## Deployment Recommendations

1. Test the plugin in a staging environment before deploying to production.
2. Configure and test the Marqo API connection before enabling the integration.
3. Start with a longer cache time to reduce API calls during initial deployment.
4. Monitor search performance after deployment to ensure optimal user experience.
